## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned more about flexbox and was able to practice more html and CSS. I am getting more confortable with my CSS code and the organisation of it.


### Continued development
